# Notes App

## React + Appwrite 

- Using React for frontend for the performance boost provided by virtual DOM for complex rendering. The page also doesn't reload only the changing component does.

- Appwrite is a open source backend as a service platform (like firebase). Using it to store the data for notes such as id, body, color, groups. It provides a convenient SDK for accessing the database.
