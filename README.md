# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Notes App

## React + Appwrite 

- Using React for frontend for the performance boost provided by virtual DOM for complex rendering. The page also doesn't reload only the changing component does.

- Appwrite is a open source backend as a service platform (like firebase). Using it to store the data for notes such as id, body, color, groups. It provides a convenient SDK for accessing the database.
